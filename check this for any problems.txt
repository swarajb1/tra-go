poetry shell:
    Ideally poetry shouldn't fork off another shell when activation of an existing virtualenv is all that's needed.

    1. Use poetry config to set the venv elsewhere that's really handy. I have my venvs live in ~/venv.
    2. Source the activate script from the virtualenv (. ~/venv/project/bin/activate) instead of poetry shell.
    3. Live in peace knowing that your environment has been treated with all the proper respect it should be.
