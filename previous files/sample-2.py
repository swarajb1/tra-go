# To interact with Zerodha Kite API and perform operations like placing orders, getting pending orders, and executed orders, you can use the `kiteconnect` library in Python. Before you begin, make sure you have installed the library by running `pip install kiteconnect`. Additionally, you'll need an API key and API secret from Zerodha. Here's an example code that demonstrates how to perform these operations:

# ```python
from kiteconnect import KiteConnect

# Zerodha API credentials
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
api_secret = "YOUR_API_SECRET"
access_token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"

# Initialize KiteConnect instance
kite = KiteConnect(api_key=api_key)

# Set access token (comment the below line if you don't have an access token yet)
kite.set_access_token(access_token)

# Generate the login URL for authorization
login_url = kite.login_url()

# Print the login URL and visit it in a web browser to authorize the application

# Get the request token after authorization
request_token = input("Enter the request token obtained after authorization: ")

# Generate the access token using the request token
data = kite.generate_session(request_token, api_secret=api_secret)
access_token = data["access_token"]

# Set the access token
kite.set_access_token(access_token)


# Place an order
def place_order():
    order = {
        "exchange": "NSE",
        "tradingsymbol": "INFY",
        "transaction_type": "BUY",
        "quantity": 1,
        "order_type": "MARKET",
        "product": "CNC",
    }
    order_id = kite.place_order(order)

    print("Order placed successfully. Order ID:", order_id)


# Get pending orders
def get_pending_orders():
    orders = kite.orders()
    pending_orders = [order for order in orders if order["status"] == "OPEN"]

    print("Pending orders:")
    for order in pending_orders:
        print(order)


# Get executed orders
def get_executed_orders():
    orders = kite.orders()
    executed_orders = [order for order in orders if order["status"] == "COMPLETE"]

    print("Executed orders:")
    for order in executed_orders:
        print(order)


# Place an order
place_order()

# Get pending orders
get_pending_orders()

# Get executed orders
get_executed_orders()
# ```

# Make sure to replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"`, `"YOUR_API_SECRET"`, and `"YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"` with your respective credentials.

# Please note that this is just a basic example to get you started. You can modify the order parameters and customize the code according to your requirements. Additionally, error handling and other functionalities are not included in this example but should be implemented in a production environment.
